# DM

INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------------------
Each DM needs to be characterized offline using an external Michelson interferometer setup before it is inserted into the beam path. By tilting the flat mirror in the reference arm of the interferometer setup, the phase induced by the DM can be obtained using Fourier fringe analysis3 and phase unwrapping4. The characterization of the DM consists of computing the influence matrix H that maps a vector u containing the voltage of each actuator of the DM to the corresponding vector z that contains the coefficients of the Zernike analysis of the phase. The matrix H is computed by collecting a set of input-output vector pairs u and z, and by solving a least-squares problem5. After it is installed, the DM can be operated in open-loop and controlled using the vector of Zernike coefficients z as the independent variable, i.e., given a vector of desired Zernike coefficients z, the voltage vector u to be applied to the DM is found by minimizing the norm squared of z-Hâˆ™u.

This program is to generate the Matrix H, namely, the control matrix.

The code was programmed and tested in Matlab 2017b.
